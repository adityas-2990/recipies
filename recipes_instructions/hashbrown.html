    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any <br>
    taste better, then you've come to the right place.<br>
    Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast<br>
    potatoes. </p>

    <p>Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be <br>
    a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that <br>
    remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try<br>
    this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed<br>
    into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the <br>
    perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any <br>
    breakfast dish. </p>

    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and <br>
            squeeze dry. </li>

        <li>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg <br>
            until evenly distributed. </li>

        <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over <br>
            medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes <br>
            into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole <br>
            bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.</li>

        <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and <br>
            brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per <br>
            side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut <br>
            into quarters for easier flipping. </li>

        <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with <br>
            salt and pepper and serve immediately. </li>
            
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
