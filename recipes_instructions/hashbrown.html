    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any <br>
    taste better, then you've come to the right place.<br>
    Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast<br>
    potatoes. </p>

    <p>Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be <br>
    a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that <br>
    remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try<br>
    this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed<br>
    into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the <br>
    perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any <br>
    breakfast dish. </p>
