    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="text" id="description">A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often <br>
        thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain <br>
        eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or <br>
        frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread.<br>
        Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in <br>
        prehistoric societies.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list" id="ingredients">
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups dry milk powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list" id="ingredients">
        <li>In a large bowl, sift all-purpose flour, milk powder, baking powder, baking <br>
            soda and salt. Stir in whole wheat flour. In a small bowl, combine sugar, eggs,<br>
            water, butter and vinegar. Make a well in the flour mixture, and pour in the egg<br>
            mixture. Mix until smooth. </li>

        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Pour or scoop the <br>
            batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until <br>
            pancakes are golden brown on both sides; serve hot. </li>
